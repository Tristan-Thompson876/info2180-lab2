                <p>Tristan is a very active person, he would start his day with a light workout before his hygienic practices and a prayer, he would then attend his classes to foster his skills and grow into his field, afterwards he goes to work and after work he normally has different clubs/societies that he will have to attend such as TMS the Tower musical society where he is an executive member. After his practices he would cook his meals then complete his assignments before going to bed.</p>
